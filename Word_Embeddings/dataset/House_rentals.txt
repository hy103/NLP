1. Get the permission from the professor. Tell them that you are very much passionate and interested to take their course

Sample - Hello Professor
I am <<>>. My ASU ID is <<>>. I am pursuing my Masters in Information Technology for fall 2022. 

I am looking to register for Spring 23 classes. I am very much excited about Computer Graphics. I have always been a huge fan of Graphics and its depth. It will be an absolute pleasure to learn the subject under your guidance and supervision.  I have conducted workshops in many colleges back in my undergrad. I have completed the course Computer Graphics in my undergrad. I am very much interested in registering for this course under your supervision and guidance professor. I am hereby requesting an override request. Please help me provide the same. 


2. Submit an override request to the concerned department 

https://fultonapps.asu.edu/override/


Main point to be noted here is that *Our override request will not be viewed/approved by the department 1 week before our class start*

The other thing is there is no guarentee that seats would be available as the first priority will go to the concerned department student

All the best! Feel free to ping me 🙂 Happy to help 🙂

11/30/22, 7:27 AM - Vamshi Krishna Asu: *For Flights*
Destination - Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport 

If you guys are thinking to land in any other state and later come here 
Example - Delhi -> LA 
Stay in LA for a week and then come here, absolutely no problem 😁😁
Immigration will happen in LA and he/she will mostly ask the basic stuff 

For flight booking, 
I would say try contacting any local agents 
They would be providing some discounts since they would be connected to the airlines

For example 
1. Qatar airways - student offer
2. Emirates - student offer

11/30/22, 8:11 AM - Vamshi Krishna Asu: Hi hello good evening everyone !
Welcome to Arizona State University 🎉🎉🎉
I am sure u guys are going to have a beautiful Masters journey !!

Coming to Information Technology it’s a very good department but the only ***t is it is not in main campus but a remote campus named Polytechnic 😥😥
But that’s okay that’s fine every day is a learning experience here it’s okay ! 

For the courses in Information Technology ! 
A short teaser about the courses we have !! 
The most popular choice of the subjects which people take that I have come across is 
IFT 510 Principles of Computer and Information Technology Arch - it’s a decent subject and obviously the core one ! It’s Professor is Dinesh Sthapit and he is okay okay prof I can say !! 

Next comes IFT 540 Information Systems Development - it’s a complete theoretical subject ! Team project is there and collaboration with several people will be fun right 😉😉
The professor is Derex Griffin🙃
He makes you stand for listening to the class. That’s the issue 

IFT 598 Data Visualization/ Reporting for IT - it’s a very good subject 👍👍 the prof is Asmaa Elbadrawy 
She is the best professor we ever have in our department 

Others 
IFT Natural Language Processing- it’s super theoretical 
Professor is Brian Atkinson and he is a ***t guy😂😂

IFT 511 Analysing Big Data - it’s a good subject ! Again Asmaa super prof 

IFT 420/598 Cloud Arch - very good subject ! Very very very useful in future 

Data in the Cloud - a good subject and again Brian so…🙃

System Admin of UNIX - it’s a super subject about UNIX and LINUX


Dm me for any queries you guys have ! Would love to help you all out !
